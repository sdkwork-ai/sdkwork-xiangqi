# Runbook — sdkwork-xiangqi deploy / upgrade / rollback (EN)

Environments: `development|test|staging|demo|production`. Commands run on the
local WSL host by default; append `--host ssh://[user@]host[:port]` for remote
targets. Image reference: `registry.sdkwork.com/apps/sdkwork-xiangqi-standalone:0.1.0`
(tag from `sdkwork.app.config.json` → `release.currentVersion`).

> ℹ️ **Delivery posture**: standalone delivery is a host package (`host-package/host-service`); cloud delivery is a container image (`container-image/kubernetes`).
> The bundle container-install path described in sections 1 (install) / 2 (upgrade) (`deployments/docker/bundle/`) applies only when the module
> enables a standalone **container** install; use `bin/apps-package.sh` + `bin/apps-pkg-installer.sh` for the host package, and let kubernetes
> orchestration consume the image produced by `bin/docker-image.sh push` for the cloud plane.

## 1. Install (first time)

```bash
bin/docker-deploy.sh install --environment <development|test|staging|demo|production>
bin/docker-deploy.sh install --environment production --yes   # --yes is mandatory in production
```

install syncs the bundle to `/opt/deploy/sdkwork-xiangqi/bundle`, loads the image, starts
instances and waits on the health gate (`/healthz`).

## 2. Upgrade

staging/demo/production capture a pre-change backup automatically (skip with
`--skip-backup`; the skip is recorded as evidence):

```bash
bin/docker-image.sh build
bin/docker-deploy.sh upgrade --environment staging --image-tag 0.1.0
```

## 3. Verify (release gate)

```bash
bin/docker-deploy.sh status --environment staging
bin/doctor.sh --environment staging          # aggregated diagnostics (9 checks)
```

## 4. Rollback

```bash
bin/docker-deploy.sh rollback --environment staging                  # previous ledger version
bin/docker-deploy.sh rollback --environment staging --to 0.1.0       # explicit version
```

Rollback is gated by `/healthz` on the management ports; a failed gate
auto-reverts and appends to `release-state/<env>/ledger.jsonl`. Migrations are
forward-only: across an incompatible schema the only recovery is a data
restore (backup-restore.md).

## 5. Retire

```bash
bin/docker-deploy.sh down --environment staging
bin/docker-deploy.sh stop    --environment staging   # stop (keeps containers and volumes; no repackage)
bin/docker-deploy.sh start   --environment staging   # start a stopped stack (embedded deps first)
bin/docker-deploy.sh restart --environment staging   # restart app instances only (deps stay up)
bin/docker-deploy.sh down --environment staging --purge --yes
```
